# Logic

these functions' role is to process and transform data. Logic functions are your standard "coding challenge" type function. In goes some data, out comes some new data.

Here are some general rules for your logic functions:

- they always need at least one argument
- they will always return a value
- they only use console.log
- they cannot use prompt, alert, or confirm
