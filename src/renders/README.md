# Renders

These functions' role is to format data so it's nice for users to read.

Here are some general rules for your render functions:

- they always need at least one argument (you need some data to display!)
- they will return a formatted version of your data
- they can only use console.log
- they cannot use prompt, alert or confirm (you will alert the return value)
